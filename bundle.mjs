 * Dispatches a click event to the given element that triggers a native action,
 * but is not composed and therefore is not seen outside the element.
 *
 * This is useful for responding to an external click event on the host element
 * that should trigger an internal action like a button click.
 *
 * Note, a helper is provided because setting this up correctly is a bit tricky.
 * In particular, calling `click` on an element creates a composed event, which
 * is not desirable, and a manually dispatched event must specifically be a
 * `MouseEvent` to trigger a native action.
 *
 * @example
 * hostClickListener = (event: MouseEvent) {
 *   if (isActivationClick(event)) {
 *     this.dispatchActivationClick(this.buttonElement);
 *   }
 * }
 *

/**
 * Returns true if the click event should trigger an activation behavior. The
 * behavior is defined by the element and is whatever it should do when
 * clicked.
 *
 * Typically when an element needs to handle a click, the click is generated
 * from within the element and an event listener within the element implements
 * the needed behavior; however, it's possible to fire a click directly
 * at the element that the element should handle. This method helps
 * distinguish these "external" clicks.
 *
 * An "external" click can be triggered in a number of ways: via a click
 * on an associated label for a form  associated element, calling
 * `element.click()`, or calling
 * `element.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', ...))`.
 *
 * Also works around Firefox issue
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1804576 by squelching
 * events for a microtask after called.
 *
 * @example
 * hostClickListener = (event: MouseEvent) {
 *   if (isActivationClick(event)) {
 *     this.dispatchActivationClick(this.buttonElement);
 *   }
 * }

 * @summary Floating action buttons (FABs) help people take primary actions.

 *
 * @description
 * __Emphasis:__ High emphasis – For the primary, most important, or most common

 *
 * __Rationale:__ The FAB remains the default component for a screen’s primary
 * action. It comes in three sizes: small FAB, FAB, and large FAB. The extended
 * FAB’s wider format and text label give it more visual prominence than a  FAB.
 * It’s often used on larger screens where a FAB would seem too small. Branded
 * FABs are used to specifically call attention to branded logo icons.
 *
 * __Example usages:__
 * - FAB
 *   - Create

 * __Rationale:__ The FAB remains the default component for a screen’s primary

 * It’s often used on larger screens where a FAB would seem too small.

/**
 * An item layout component that can be used inside list items to give them

 *
 * `<md-item>` does not have any functionality, which must be added by the
 * component using it.
 *
 * All text will wrap unless `white-space: nowrap` is set on the item or any of
 * its children.
 *
 * Slots available:
 * - `<default>`: The headline, or custom content.
 * - `headline`: The first line.
 * - `supporting-text`: Supporting text lines underneath the headline.
 * - `trailing-supporting-text`: A small text snippet at the end of the item.
 * - `start`: Any leading content, such as icons, avatars, or checkboxes.
 * - `end`: Any trailing content, such as icons and buttons.
 * - `container`: Background container content, intended for adding additional
 *     styles, such as ripples or focus rings.
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <md-item>Single line</md-item>
 *
 * <md-item>
 *   <div class="custom-content">...</div>
 * </md-item>
 *
 * <!-- Classic 1 to 3+ line list items -->
 * <md-item>
 *   <md-icon slot="start">image</md-icon>
 *   <div slot="overline">Overline</div>
 *   <div slot="headline">Headline</div>
 *   <div="supporting-text">Supporting text</div>
 *   <div="trailing-supporting-text">Trailing</div>
 *   <md-icon slot="end">image</md-icon>
 * </md-item>
 * ```
 *
 * When wrapping `<md-item>`, forward the available slots to use the same slot
 * structure for the wrapping component (this is what `<md-list-item>` does).
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <md-item>
 *   <slot></slot>

 * @summary
 * Lists are continuous, vertical indexes of text or images. Items are placed
 * inside the list.
 *
 * @description
 * Lists consist of one or more list items, and can contain actions represented
 * by icons and text. List items come in three sizes: one-line, two-line, and
 * three-line.
 *
 * __Takeaways:__
 *
 * - Lists should be sorted in logical ways that make content easy to scan, such
 *   as alphabetical, numerical, chronological, or by user preference.
 * - Lists present content in a way that makes it easy to identify a specific
 *   item in a collection and act on it.
 * - Lists should present icons, text, and actions in a consistent format.
 *
 * Acceptable slot child variants are:
 *
 * - `img[slot=end]`
 * - `img[slot=start]`
 *
 *  @example
 * ```html
 * <md-list-item
 *     headline="User Name"
 *     supportingText="user@name.com">
 *   <md-icon slot="start">account_circle</md-icon>
 *   <md-icon slot="end">check</md-icon>
 * </md-list-item>
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 *
 * @final
 * @suppress {visibility}

/**
 * @summary Menus display a list of choices on a temporary surface.
 *
 * @description
 * Menus appear when users interact with a button, action, or other control.
 *
 * They can be opened from a variety of elements, most commonly icon buttons,
 * buttons, and text fields.
 *
 * md-menu listens for the `close-menu` and `deselect-items` events.
 *
 * - `close-menu` closes the menu when dispatched from a child element.
 * - `deselect-items` deselects all of its immediate menu-item children.
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <div style="position:relative;">
 *   <button
 *       id="anchor"
 *       @click=${() => this.menuRef.value.show()}>
 *     Click to open menu
 *   </button>
 *   <!--
 *     `has-overflow` is required when using a submenu which overflows the
 *     menu's contents.
 *
 *     Additionally, `anchor` ingests an idref which do not pass through shadow
 *     roots. You can also set `.anchorElement` to an element reference if
 *     necessary.
 *   -->
 *   <md-menu anchor="anchor" has-overflow ${ref(menuRef)}>
 *     <md-menu-item headline="This is a headline"></md-menu-item>
 *     <md-sub-menu>
 *       <md-menu-item
 *           slot="item"
 *           headline="this is a submenu item">
 *       </md-menu-item>
 *       <md-menu slot="menu">
 *         <md-menu-item headline="This is an item inside a submenu">
 *         </md-menu-item>
 *       </md-menu>
 *     </md-sub-menu>

/**
 * @summary Menus display a list of choices on a temporary surface.
 *
 * @description
 * Menu items are the selectable choices within the menu. Menu items must
 * implement the `Menu` interface and also have the `md-menu`
 * attribute. Additionally menu items are list items so they must also have the
 * `md-list-item` attribute.
 *
 * Menu items can control a menu by selectively firing the `close-menu` and
 * `deselect-items` events.
 *
 * This menu item will open a sub-menu that is slotted in the `submenu` slot.
 * Additionally, the containing menu must either have `has-overflow` or
 * `positioning=fixed` set to `true` in order to display the containing menu
 * properly.
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <div style="position:relative;">
 *   <button
 *       id="anchor"
 *       @click=${() => this.menuRef.value.show()}>
 *     Click to open menu
 *   </button>
 *   <!--
 *     `has-overflow` is required when using a submenu which overflows the
 *     menu's contents
 *   -->
 *   <md-menu anchor="anchor" has-overflow ${ref(menuRef)}>
 *     <md-menu-item headline="This is a headline"></md-menu-item>
 *     <md-sub-menu>
 *       <md-menu-item
 *           slot="item"
 *           headline="this is a submenu item">
 *       </md-menu-item>
 *       <md-menu slot="menu">
 *         <md-menu-item headline="This is an item inside a submenu">
 *         </md-menu-item>
 *       </md-menu>
 *     </md-sub-menu>

 *   <!-- An empty selected option will give select an "un-filled" state -->
 *   <md-select-option selected></md-select-option>
 *   <md-select-option value="apple" headline="Apple"></md-select-option>

 * Select menus display a list of choices on temporary surfaces and display the

 *
 * @description
 * The select component allows users to choose a value from a fixed list of
 * available options. Composed of an interactive anchor button and a menu, it is
 * analogous to the native HTML `<select>` element. This is the option that
 * can be placed inside of an md-select.
 *
 * This component is a subclass of `md-menu-item` and can accept the same slots,
 * properties, and events as `md-menu-item`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <md-outlined-select label="fruits">
 *   <!-- An empty selected option will give select an "un-filled" state -->
 *   <md-select-option selected></md-select-option>
 *   <md-select-option value="apple" headline="Apple"></md-select-option>
 *   <md-select-option value="banana" headline="Banana"></md-select-option>
 *   <md-select-option value="kiwi" headline="Kiwi"></md-select-option>
 *   <md-select-option value="orange" headline="Orange"></md-select-option>

     * is gated on the handle being hovered. In addition, because the ripple
     * hover state is being specially handled, it must be triggered independent

// - The value may be initially null, and then contain an object when the information arrives over the network.
// - At that time, it may be set to a dumb object with static properties such as title, optional description and picture.
//   Such properties are not changed, except by replacing the entire record value.

//   will get updated only when the title referenced record rule changes.
// - The record and it's tag-named rule may also be removed from the collection (such that referenced to that tag yield undefined).

//   resolving to the live simple record from that directory.
